    "# NBA Players Injury Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "- NBA player injuries are trending up. Costing money from owners, wins from coaches and players, and ruinning expectations of fans by watching the teams star player on the bench in street clothes. In 2014-15 injuries to 2 key players, Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving during playoffs created too big a hurdle for Lebron James and the Cavaliers to beat the Golden State warriors in the NBA finals. The Los Angeles Clippers organization has been plagued with the \"Clipper curse\" due to untimely and unfortunate injuries. The most rescent Clipper injuries, Chris Paul fractures his left hand during early round playoffs 2015-16 season while Blake Griffin- another Clipper all-star- is nursing a strained hamstring. \n",
    "\n",
    "Shaun Livingston, drafted 4th pick by the Clippers in 2004, during midseason 2007 injures almost every part of his knee, tearing the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), and the lateral meniscus, badly spraining his medial collateral ligament (MCL), and dislocating his patella and his tibio-fibular joint.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Goal\n",
    "- Create an analysis on nba players injuries by focusing on games played for each player in a given season. Each NBA team plays 82 games a season. My goal is to create a model to predict total games played in 2016-17 for each nba player.\n",
